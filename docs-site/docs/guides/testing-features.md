## Installing the Testing Version

### Home Assistant Add-on

Currently, there is no dedicated Testing add-on. To test:

1. Use the Alpha add-on repository: `https://github.com/riddix/home-assistant-addons`
2. Manually update to the testing Docker tag if available
3. Or build from source using the `testing` branch

### Docker

Use the `testing` tag:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name home-assistant-matter-hub-testing \
  --network host \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -e HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
  -e HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token \
  matheusdevelope/home-assistant-matter-hub:testing
```
