## 🎉 What's New

<details>
<summary><strong>📦 Stable Features (v2.0.42)</strong> - Click to expand</summary>

**New in v2.0.42 (hotfix release):**

- 🇯🇵 Aqara bridge registration no longer stalls — root `softwareVersionString` now matches the numeric `softwareVersion` ([#316](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/316))
- ❄️ Climate `auto` mode is clamped to `heat`/`cool` on devices without an `AutoMode` base ([#319](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/319))
- 🌀 Per-entity `disableClimateFanControl` mapping flag — falls back to `ThermostatDevice` when controllers like Aqara don't recognise `RoomAirConditioner` (`0x0072`) ([#318](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/318))
- 🗺️ Vacuum service area `selectedAreas` is kept after dispatch instead of being cleared

**Previously in v2.0.41:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| 🌀 Google Home fan speed | Uses `fan.set_percentage` so already-on fans pick up speed changes from Google Home ([#308](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/308)) |
| ❄️ Climate auto mode | Expose Matter Auto mode when HA reports `auto` in `hvac_modes` ([#309](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/309)) |
| 🆔 Server-mode root identity | Root identity now applies as a single transaction, so controllers don't drop devices mid-swap ([#311](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/311)) |
| 🪟 Lift-only blinds | No more `TiltBlindTiltOnly` on covers without tilt — fixes Alexa routines for roller blinds ([#312](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/312)) |
| 🏷️ Per-entity `disableClimateOnOff` | Turn off the OnOff cluster on climate endpoints per entity for controllers that prefer mode-only control |
| 🔢 `serialNumberSuffix` per bridge | Append a suffix to every entity serial — useful if controllers like Aqara cache stale device data |

## 🤖 Robot Vacuum Server Mode

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Important: Apple Home & Alexa require Server Mode for Robot Vacuums</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### The Problem

Apple Home and Alexa **do not properly support bridged robot vacuums**. When your vacuum is exposed through a standard Matter bridge, you may experience:

- **Apple Home**: "Updating" status, Siri commands don't work, room selection fails
- **Alexa**: Vacuum is not discovered at all

This is because these platforms expect robot vacuums to be **standalone Matter devices**, not bridged devices.

### The Solution: Server Mode

**Server Mode** exposes your vacuum as a standalone Matter device without the bridge wrapper. This makes it fully compatible with Apple Home and Alexa.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a new bridge** in the Matter Hub web interface
2. **Enable "Server Mode"** checkbox in the bridge creation wizard
3. Add **only your vacuum** to this bridge
4. **Pair the new Server Mode bridge** with Apple Home or Alexa
5. Your other devices stay on your regular bridge(s)

### Important Notes

- Server Mode bridges support **exactly one device**
- Your vacuum needs its own dedicated Server Mode bridge
- Other device types (lights, switches, sensors) work fine on regular bridges
- After switching to Server Mode, Siri commands like "Hey Siri, start the vacuum" will work

### Documentation

For more details, see the [Robot Vacuum Documentation](https://riddix.github.io/home-assistant-matter-hub/devices/robot-vacuum).

## 🔧 Network Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ "No Response" / Connection Drops — Common Network Causes</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### The Problem

Your Matter devices suddenly show **"No Response"** (Apple Home), **"Unavailable"** (Google Home), or become **unresponsive** after some time — even though the bridge is still running and other controllers (e.g., Alexa) continue to work fine.

### Root Cause: Network Equipment Blocking mDNS/Multicast

Matter relies heavily on **mDNS (multicast DNS)** for device discovery and reachability. Many routers, access points, and managed switches have features that **filter, throttle, or block multicast traffic** — which breaks Matter communication silently.

> **💡 This was confirmed and documented thanks to the excellent systematic testing by [@omerfaruk-aran](https://github.com/omerfaruk-aran) in [#129](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/129).** The issue was traced to a TP-Link Archer AX50 (in AP mode) sitting between the Apple TV and the network — its default settings were blocking/limiting mDNS/Bonjour traffic over time.

### What to Check on Your Network Equipment

1. **IGMP Snooping** — Disable or configure it to allow mDNS (`224.0.0.251` / `ff02::fb`)
2. **Multicast Optimization / Multicast Enhancement** — Disable (often called "Airtime Fairness" or "Multicast to Unicast")
3. **AP Isolation / Client Isolation** — Must be **disabled** so devices on the same network can communicate
4. **mDNS / Bonjour Forwarding** — Enable if available (some enterprise APs have this)
5. **DHCP Server on secondary devices** — Disable DHCP on access points / switches that are NOT your main router (multiple DHCP servers cause IP conflicts)
6. **Firmware Updates** — Update your router/AP firmware, as multicast handling is frequently improved

### Affected Equipment (Known Cases)

| Device | Issue | Fix |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **TP-Link Archer AX50** (AP mode) | mDNS traffic blocked/limited over time | Firmware update + disable DHCP on the AP |
| **Ubiquiti UniFi APs** | IGMP Snooping can filter mDNS | Disable IGMP Snooping or enable mDNS Reflector |
| **Managed Switches** (various) | Multicast filtering enabled by default | Allow mDNS multicast groups |

### Quick Diagnostic Steps

1. **Does Alexa still work when Apple Home shows "No Response"?**
   - **Yes** → Bridge is online, the issue is network path / mDNS related
   - **No** → Bridge may actually be down, check HAMH logs

2. **Does removing a Home Hub (HomePod/Apple TV) fix it?**
   - **Yes** → The hub's network path is affected (AP/switch between hub and bridge)
   - **No** → May be a different issue

3. **Try binding mDNS to a specific interface:**
   ```
   --mdns-network-interface eth0
   ```
   (or `end0`, `enp0s18`, etc. — check your system)

### Network Topology Tips

- **Keep the path simple**: Avoid placing access points or managed switches between your Matter bridge (Home Assistant) and your Home Hub (HomePod/Apple TV)
- **Use wired connections** where possible for Home Hubs and the Home Assistant host
- **Same subnet**: All Matter devices, controllers, and the bridge must be on the same Layer 2 network / subnet
- **IPv6**: Matter requires IPv6 — do not disable it. For VLAN setups, configure **ULA addresses** (`fd00::/8`), not just link-local (`fe80::`). See [Troubleshooting](https://home-assistant-matter-hub.riddix.dev/guides/connectivity-issues#ipv6) and [Discussion #39](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/discussions/39)

## Migration from t0bst4r

Migrating from the original `t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub` is straightforward. **Your Matter fabric connections and paired devices will be preserved!**

### Home Assistant Add-on

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   cp -r /addon_configs/*_hamh /config/hamh-backup
   # Verify the backup was copied correctly
   ls /config/hamh-backup
   ```

2. **Uninstall the old add-on** (Settings → Add-ons → Uninstall) and make sure the old folder is removed:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /addon_configs/*_hamh
   ```

3. **Add the new repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
   ```

4. **Install and start the new add-on once** (creates the data folder), then **stop it**

5. **Clear the new folder and restore your backup:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf /addon_configs/*_hamh/*
   cp -r /config/hamh-backup/* /addon_configs/*_hamh/
   ```

6. **Start the add-on again** - your devices should reconnect automatically

### Docker / Docker Compose

Simply change the image from:
```
ghcr.io/t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```
to:
```
matheusdevelope/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

Your volume mounts stay the same - no data migration needed.
